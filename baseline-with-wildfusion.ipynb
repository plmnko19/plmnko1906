    "# Baseline with WildFusion 🦙 🧬\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an improved baseline for individual identification using the **[MegaDescriptor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09118)** with **[ALIKED](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03608)** methods, combined using [WildFusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12934).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is WildFusion?  \n",
    "WildFusion is a **feature fusion method** designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of models in individual recognition tasks. Traditional identification models often rely on a single type of feature representation, which may struggle with variations in lighting, angles, and occlusions. WildFusion overcomes these challenges by combining multiple feature extraction techniques, resulting in a more comprehensive and adaptable approach.  "

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
